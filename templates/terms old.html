                        your personal data. Although {{site.name}} will make commercially reasonable efforts to

        Cryptocurrency transactions
       </b>
       <br/>
       {{site.name}} guarantees the value of cryptocurrency and will bear the loss that arises from the change in prices.
       <br/>
       The cryptocurrency network is managed by a decentralized network of independent third
                        parties. As soon as a transaction request is sent to the cryptocurrency network through the
                        Services, the cryptocurrency network will automatically terminate or reject the request, and
                        you cannot cancel or otherwise change your transaction request. You acknowledge and
                        agree that {{site.name}} is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection
                        with any cryptocurrency transaction initiated through the Services. Services help you send a
                        cryptocurrency transaction request for confirmation in a cryptocurrency network. However,
                        {{site.name}} does not control the cryptocurrency network and, therefore, cannot and does not
                        guarantee that any transaction request you send through the Services will be executed. You
                        acknowledge and agree that requests for transactions that you send through the Services
                        may not be executed or may be significantly delayed by the cryptocurrency network. When
                        you execute a transaction request through the Services, you authorize us to send a
                        transaction request to the cryptocurrency network in accordance with the instructions that
                        you provide through the Services.

       If you give explicit permission to a third party to connect to your account either through a
                        third party product or through {{site.name}}, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third
                        party to perform certain actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your obligations
                        under this Agreement. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that you will not be
                        responsible for {{site.name}} and will not relieve {{site.name}} of any liability arising from the actions or
